    <h3 class="question">
      What is the derivative?
    </h3>
    <p class="thinking">
        To answer this question, we should get our minds 
        into thinking about the general concept, rather than the formula you might have seen.

    Start by looking at the graph below. This graph tells us the position of a car over time,
    with meters on the y-axis and seconds on the x-axis. Can you find the speed of the car?
  </p>

  <p>
    If we look at the graph, we can find how far the car travels in a certain amount of time.
    This is what we call slope.
  </p>
  <p>
    We see the car travels 2 meters for every second, which means it is traveling 2 m/s.
    This is fairly simple for us, but how would we find the slope using the slope
    formula we were taught in school?
  </p>
  <p>
    We all have heard "rise over run". With it, there is a formula: (y2-y1)/(x2-x1). 
    What is this formula saying?
